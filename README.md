# Gesture based controller

This package collects ROS nodes that map IMU data to velocity commands for mobile robots.

## Installation

Clone the repository in the source folder of your catkin workspace.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EmaroLab/gesture-based-controller.git
```

## Dependencies

In order to succesfully run the code, you should have installed [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu).

## Nodes description

**_gb_controller_** : It performs a linear mapping of accelerations recorded by an IMU sensor to the velocity commands for a mobile robot.

The mapping coefficients depend on the robot to control and they can be set from launch file.


```python
    twist.linear.x = x * linear_coefficient
    twist.angular.z = y * angular_coefficient
```
